# About This Fork

This is a fork of the _Duplo_ duplicate source code checker. It currently lives
at http://github.com/bitfehler/duplo. The original Duplo project page is at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/duplo, and the home page is
http://duplo.giants.ch (which seems to be the SF hosted home page.

I think code duplication can be a serious issue and found this tool to be quite
handy. It works well, yet I noticed its code could need some lovin' after all
these years. Since most other tools of this sort seem to be written in Java -
which most C programmers don't really like to deal with :) - I figured it would
be worthwhile creating this repo and spent some time on it. So, if you are
interested... well, happy forking!

Below is the original README reproduced in all its glory. It fails to mention
it, but for building the executable, just call _make_ ;)

1 GENERAL INFORMATION

Duplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.
Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large C, C++, Java, C# and 
VB.Net systems.

- Sample output snippet -
...
src\engine\geometry\simple\TorusGeometry.cpp(56)
src\engine\geometry\simple\SphereGeometry.cpp(54)
	pBuffer[currentIndex*size+3]=(i+1)/(float)subdsU;
	pBuffer[currentIndex*size+4]=j/(float)subdsV;
	currentIndex++;
	pPrimitiveBuffer->unlock();

src\engine\geometry\subds\SubDsGeometry.cpp(37)
src\engine\geometry\SkinnedMeshGeometry.cpp(45)
    pBuffer[i*size+0]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3];
    pBuffer[i*size+1]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+1];
    pBuffer[i*size+2]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+2];
...

3 BACKGROUND

Duplo uses the same techniques as Duploc to detect duplicated code blocks. See
